<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
  I'm <strong>Evyatar</strong>, a <strong>Game Developer</strong> based in <strong>London, UK</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  I love developing <span data-card="games">Games</span> in <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Unreal Engine</em>,
  and creating <span data-card="portfolio">unique and interactive designs</span> using the latest HTML5, CSS3 and Object Oriented JavaScript design patterns.
</p>
<p>
  I have experience with SEO, developing responsive designs, and working closely with various APIs, as well as some less-interesting backend and miscellaneous technologies such as: PHP, MySQL, XML/XSL, etc.
